#Yyanu&#39;s Tale
I find myself in the desert. However the scene is slightly different than the vanilla server. I see a caravan and a tent set up. A person dressed in rugged travelling clothes sits outside the tent under a large canopy. A a few horses and camels are nearby. A [[sign in the road-&gt;caravansign01]] encourages me to approach [[the person by the tent-&gt;greetingpleb01]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="server concept" tags="" position="531,185" size="100,100">#Caligula the Conan Exile&#39;s Server
Review [[Conan Exiles]] if you want.
Skip this and go straight to the [[caravanserai]] 
Follow me along through [[Yyanu&#39;s tale]] 


##Lore
Exile is a seperate plane of existence. The Conan Exiles lore is all exactly as described in the Game. However a particularly depraved Roman Emperor say Caligula perhaps in his quest to evade mortality used dark arts to find his way here along with some of his lictors and key members of his court. Once in Exile he was able to found a shadow of his former Empire. The power of the ghost wall and the bracelets have been co-opted by the Emperor to serve his ambitions.

The centerpiece of New Rome is the Circus, where every manner of blood sport is pursued to the highest level of excellence and the lowest level of depravity. While the city operates like other cities with rigid class hierarchies, social mobility is available to all who would brave the Circus.


##Reasons to play on this server:

0. To practice intense and varied PVP inside a strong RP framework.

In character creation I created an older Vendyhan woman named Yyanu. I have silver hair, a hardened look, and well defined physique. I&#39;m hoping to play a seasoned veteran of combat looking to transition from living by the blade to something more sustainable in my middle age. Maybe a woman with hopes of leaving something other than a trail of dead men as her legacy.

I like though that I haven&#39;t had to get approval yet of my backstory since I don&#39;t really know much about the lore of Caligula except that it&#39;s about gladiators.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="choosePat" tags="" position="1074,820" size="100,100">Marus explains:

&quot;The Patricians are the ruling class in New Rome. Patricians can own estates and slaves and are eligible to run for senate. Their persons and property are protected by the city guard but are vulnerable to guild sanctioned assassination. They are subject to complex rules of ettiquette and honor have the right to challenge or be challenged in duels. They have a guaranteed income. Only Patricians can be [[editors-&gt;lexEditor]] and own [[gladiatorial colleges-&gt;lexCollege]]. The life of a Patrician is rich with undeserved privilege and unwieldy responsibility.&quot; 

&quot;If you believe you belong to the ruling class then you should enter the tent and make your case to my Lady Galeta.  If she recognizes you as a fellow patrician you will travel in luxury to the Palace in New Rome where you may find your appropriate office.&quot;

You will find many of the like living in wretched squalor about the lands of Exilium.&quot; 

Marus looks grave.

&quot;You will have no status, no rights, and of course no responsibilities. You have no legal protection from robbers, brigands, or slavers.  You will require permission, not easily obtained, to enter the city walls of New Rome.

Marus breaks character in order for the admin&#39;s to pass on this important warning:

Choosing the path of the Barbarian or outlaw is very challenging because harvest and XP rates are terrible on this server. Plebians and patricians can choose roles or professions that provide income, kits, levels and feats. Barbarians have to grind their way up the levels on a punishing server. This is truly hard mode. 

In addition, KOS (kill on sight) is permitted against barbarians and outlaws with little to no meta protection. 

The upside is that you are free from many of the rules that constrain the other classes. You are also free to join the circus as a gladiator and you are subject to being enslaved (if that&#39;s your fancy). An outlaw can work their way through luck and skill into the other classes and can rise to fame or notoriety. Outlaws can build their own strongholds in the countryside and protect them against other Barbarians and the advancing vanguard of civilization. There are rumours of barbarian and outlaw clans out there. 

The rules may seem stacked against this choice, but that is only because the admins want players to choose this route because they want the challenge and are ready to be fatalistic or good natured about the obstacles that come their way. This is the best class choice for players who embrace the Dwarf Fortress motto: &quot;losing is fun!&quot;

A figure dressed in dusty desert robes emerges from behind the Caravanserai and nods.  Marus leads me over to introduce us.

&quot;Septima, this is Yyanu.  A newly gated exile. She is of worthy stock like yourself and I. She would seek passage to the Market in New Rome. I&#39;m sure she can be of use to you along the way and if not, she will surely repay you in short order once established in our Beloved Emperorors&#39; beneficient domain.&quot;

Septima peers at you appraisingly for a minute through a narrow eyeslit behind a sand-colored veil. Then seeminly satisfied she tears the veil away and reveals a smiling face well weathered by the sun and wind. With a grin she offers to embrace you and attempts to place a kiss on your left cheek. 

&quot;Yyanu, my sister! I see you are just as Marus says. Worthy stock indeed. Come join me. I will enjoy your company on the road to New Rome!&quot;

Marus&#39;s face seems to set itself into a faint mask of rigid politeness.
He bows graciously to you with perhaps just a hint of a wry expression, er no you must be mistaken, he is utterly respectful.

He opens the curtain flap covering the tent entrance and speaks to someone out of sight. 

&quot;It is as you said, my leige. She is one of yours. I&#39;ll send her in directly, my lady.&quot;

Marus then steps asside making space for me to walk into the tent.

She will have a series of questions IC and OOC to confirm a players committment to the tedious role of patrician.

* Must be willing to live by complicated code of honour.

* More RP responsibility to other players as Pats have to facilitate
* Vulnerable to be challenged to duels, contract assassination.
* Constrained PVP rules.
* Preferably experienced in Caligula with a past character.
* Must have a good understanding of the Server Rules. (Something like Trevor&#39;s quiz from the old ISE server)


Idea: a scored personality test. The end score will be interpretted to give the player an arbitrary idea of how suitable they are. They may still choose pat role but be forewarned.
