# caligula
Rules, Mods, and other specifications for a Conan Exiles Server based on an Ancient Roman Gladiator economy 

Everything is on the [Wiki](https://github.com/Yyanu-nav/caligula/wiki) right now. So use that. 

Conan Exiles is a multiplayer survival game by Funcom. Caligula is the working title for a private server inspired by the Ancient Roman Empire and the gladiator economy. 

This repository is a place to develop and discuss the rules, policies, mods, and other choices administrative choices that could make the server an enjoyable reality. 

My name is Yyanu Nav. I'm the host of this repository and my dream would be to administer my own Conan Exiles server at some point. However if I find the right partner or team I might pass control to them at some point. For now, however this is my vision but I am excited to accept feedback and input from others. Using git anyone can contribute ... or even branch off from my vision. My vision grows from basic principles which I'll call the Axioms. 

Interested? Have a comment?  Go to the [WIKI](https://github.com/Yyanu-nav/caligula/wiki)

thanks,
