# Caligula Proto-Schematic

This document tries to map out exactly what I have actually placed to date in a local game. The purpose is to record my experiments and ulitmately to create a recipe for deployment of a real server. Since my local game will be deleted (though individual mushi scripts and kits might still be saveable) it is the local game is a prototype for the server. This "schematic" is also a prototype for future schematics or recipes. I will use this to learn how to develop a server recipe.

_Honestly I could see converting this to a Harlowe/twine IF page or a wiki. Where each informational node... hmmm_

# Mod list
Numbered list of mods in order:
 1. Pippi
 
# Regions list
Make a list of admin defined general locations where development happens. Regions are not defined by strick location parameters (that occurs in maybe something called *building plan*). Regions are human readable descriptions of places with a theme or certain activity. Large Regions may contain smaller regions.

 1. [New Rome](#new-rome)
 2. [Caravanserai](#caravanserai)
 3. [Ambush](#ambush)
 4. [Gate of Ivrel](#gate-of-ivrel)
 5. [Palace](#palace)
 
 # Thespian List
 List of the thespians, names, description, kit and links to their region, kit, and mushi script. In plain language describe their functions. In pseudo-code describe quests etc. 

# Region's Defined
Not sure why this is separate from the list. Will revisit the logic here.

## New Rome
A big city.

## Palace
Inside [New Rome](##new-rome) this palace is where patricians mingle.
