# Caligula Proto-Schematic

This document tries to map out exactly what I have actually placed to date in a local game. The purpose is to record my experiments and ulitmately to create a recipe for deployment of a real server. Since my local game will be deleted (though individual mushi scripts and kits might still be saveable) it is the local game is a prototype for the server. This "schematic" is also a prototype for future schematics or recipes. I will use this to learn how to develop a server recipe.

//Honestly I could see converting this to a Harlowe/twine IF page or a wiki. Where each informational node... hmmm//
