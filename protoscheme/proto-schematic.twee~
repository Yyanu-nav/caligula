Caligula Proto-Schematic
 
This document tries to map out exactly what I have actually placed to date in a local game. The purpose is to record my experiments and ulitmately to create a recipe for deployment of a real server. Since my local game will be deleted (though individual mushi scripts and kits might still be saveable) it is the local game is a prototype for the server. This "schematic" is also a prototype for future schematics or recipes. I will use this to learn how to develop a server recipe.
Begin exploring with the [[Project Walkthrough]].
Or look at the massive index of every node [[Index]].

:: Project Walkthrough
Install mods from [[Modlist]]

Designate regions in order:
[[rg Gate of Ivrel]]
[[rg Caravanserai]] or [[rg Shattered Road]]
[[rg New Rome]] or [[rg Ambush]]
[[rg Palance]] or [[rg Market]] or [[rg Slave Pits]]

Create Thespians

Numbered list of mods in order:

:: Regions list
Make a list of admin defined general locations where development happens. Regions are not defined by strick location parameters (that occurs in maybe something called *building plan*). Regions are human readable descriptions of places with a theme or certain activity. Large Regions may contain smaller regions.

 1. [[New Rome|rg New Rome]]
 2. [[Caravanserai|rg Caravanserai]]
 3. [[Ambush|rg Ambush]]
 4. [[Gate of Ivrel|rg Gate of Ivrel]]
 5. [[Palace|rg Palace]]
 
:: Thespian List
 List of the thespians, names, description, kit and links to their region, kit, and mushi script. In plain language describe their functions. In pseudo-code describe quests etc. 
[[ts Marus]]
[[ts Galeta]]
[[ts Septima]]


:: rg New Rome
A big city. Contains the [Palace](#palace); mansions of all patricians... I picture a teired city similar to "Charisat" in _City of Bones_ by Martha Wells with the palace near the top. Almost every plebeian guild headquaters and living arrangement is in the city.

::# New Rome Regions
[Palace](#palace)

::# New Rome Buildings

:: rg Caravanserai
This is the game openning spawn point. Contains thespians to greet new players and offer them RP roles and streams to begin. 

Thespians in Caravanserai:
[[ts Marus]]
[[ts Galeta]]
[[ts Septima]]

Buildings
[[Caravan Tent]]

:: Caravan Tent
[Marus](#marus) waits outside. Galeta and necessary attendents are inside. 

:: Caravan
[Septima](#septima) is at the Caravan

:: Highway

:: rg Palace
Inside [New Rome](#new-rome) this palace is where patricians mingle. Players that claim patrician status will be delivered to the Palace. 

:: SetStories
SetStories are a highlevel chain of events that may be experienced by players. (will reconsider the terminology). 
SetStories are distinct from organic stories that all players are creating ans experiencing in that they are facilitated by the server design. 
Specifically SetStories generall consist of locations, thespians and quests. The word "quest" refers to the specific object of the same name in the mushi  programming language.
