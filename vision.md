What do the players do?

1. The game is about the gladitorial arena's of ancient Rome, transported to the Exiled lands and fused with the lore of Hyborea. In particular it is about the lives of gladiators, the battles, the intigues and scandals that dictate their destiny.
2. Characters in the game are either gladiators, plebians or patricians. All lives revolve in some way around the circus. Gladiators fight in the circus, plebeians support the games through their labour and services. Patricians profit off the games by managing the gladiators, exploiting their pain and their bloodshed.
3. Players role play as characters manipulating toons or avatars in the game called Conan Exiles. Some administrative players can manage the economy and spawn NPCs for dramatic effect. Players role play logged in and also publish some of their experiences in and out of character on the Discord channel. 


My Vision:

I want the focus of the game to be on collectively creating a cohesive society around the gladitatorial circus. This means I want to co-erce and encourage players to interact with the rp economy over independent exploring and construction. I want the server to include a great capital city and possibly other towns. Players should find it easier to earn gold and levels through participation in the urban economy than through homesteading. I want the most effective way to earn money to be through arena PVP on a flexible enough schedule to allow casual play. I want opportunities for players to grind or build empires if they wish to sink more time into the game.

I want PVP, theft, assasination, diplomacy, entrepreneurship and other activities to be both challenging and rewarding---I want good mechanism in place to help diffuse the OOC player conflict that can arise out of these play activities.
